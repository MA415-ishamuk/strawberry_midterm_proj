# MA415 Midterm Project - Strawberry Exploratory Data Analysis

Isha Mukundan

## Project Description 
To complete the assignment, focus on strawberries grown in California and Florida only and explore these issues:

1. Pick three chemical treatments used for conventional strawberries in both states and contrast their use. Try to find chemicals with divergent use patterns between the states. Produce, tables, plots, and descriptions of the chemicals, how they are used, and how their use differs between California and Florida.

2. Compare the production and sales of organic and conventional strawberries and strawberries sold for processing. Show differences in price and volume between California and Florida. How do price, cost, and volume relationships change over the years?

Submit your assignment by posting the URL of your project's GitHub repository. Your repository should include your complete Rproject with all code, data, and other files necessary to download and run the project. Your repository should also include a PDF of your midterm document.

Please note the general rubric on the final page of the syllabus. Please be sure your code runs. Ideally, your document should read well with and without echoing the code and commentary. The commentary can contain personal expressions as well as technical information. Of course, turn in the document with the echo turned off.

Be sure to cite your sources, including individuals, websites, and chatbots. In your commentary, include information about how you validated your cited sources.
